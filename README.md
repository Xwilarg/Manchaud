Manchaud is a video game made for the **Green Game Jam**.<br/><br/>
In this game you control a penguin which try to avoid being eaten by an orc (and a norval) but mean humans are killing the planet by heating it :'(.<br/>
You must prevent the human to melt your glacier by **being green**, who is over-consumating.<br/><br/>
*Survive as long as possible in this asymetrical game.*<br/>
