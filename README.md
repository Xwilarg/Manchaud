Manchaud is a video game made for the **Green Game Jam**.<br/><br/>
In this game you control a penguin which try to avoid being eaten by an orca (and a norval) but mean humans are killing the planet by heating it :'(.<br/>
You must prevent the human to melt your glacier by **being green**, who is over-consumating.<br/><br/>
*Survive as long as possible in this asymetrical game.*<br/>
# How to play ?
You can control the penguin on the left of your screen with WASD/Arrow (or even a controller!).<br/>
You must avoid to fall in water or to be killed by the orca and/or the norval.<br/>
Pay close attention to see when and where they are going to attack.<br/><br/>
In the right part of your screen, an AI is moving around, switching the differents devices.<br/>
You can close the fridge, switch off the lights and turn off the screens to avoid consume too much.<br/>
However you can't turn off the radiators, make sure to keep the heat inside the rooms by closing the windows and the doors so they won't consume too much energy.<br/><br/>
If it happens, this will have a negative impact on the environment and the ice of the banquise will begin to melt.<br/>
You lose when your penguin die.<br/>
